# NeoSprite6502

A sprite editor written in HTML and JavaScript for the **Olimex Neo6502** computer.  
It is designed to work with **Neo6502 BASIC**, developed by **Paul Robson**, allowing users to create and edit sprites that can be exported in the `.gfx` format for use in BASIC programs.

## Description

NeoSprite6502 provides a simple browser-based interface where users can select, edit, and export sprites or tiles for the Neo6502 platform.  
It has not yet been thoroughly tested, but supports editing and exporting of sprite graphics compatible with Neo6502 BASIC.

## Features

- 16×16 and 32×32 sprite editing modes  
- Magenta default background (used as the transparent color)  
- Pixel brush and fill tools  
- Sprite selection and thumbnail preview  
- Export sprites as `.gfx` files with custom names  
- Runs directly in your browser with no installation required
